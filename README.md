## Before explaining about the methologies and tech stack used lets see about this project :

Creating a web application using create-react-app. The application should have following features:
1. Create a user card grid layout having navbar showing brand name
2. Adding a button in the navabr saying "Get Users" which makes an API call to get the users data.
3. Use "https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1" to get the data
4. Show a loader while the API fetches the data.
5. Use custom CSS/styled-components/SASS
